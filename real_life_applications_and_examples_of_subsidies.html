			<tr><td><p style = "color:white;font-size:13px;" align = "center">Subsidies have many real life applications, and examples, where they bring a "positive change" to communities/businesses/individuals etc., and also have applications and examples, where they don't bring about the most "positive changes", on a relative basis. To start with, an example where subsidies are "helpful", comes from the sector of housing, where "subsidising rent" and/or "building low cost homes", could greatly benefit society, and economy. This is because, everybody needs to have a roof over their heads, so they can protect themselves from "extreme" weather events, "high" or/and "low" temperatures, etc. However, not everyone can afford houses, and their lives might be at risk! In such cases, subsidising rent, and building low cost homes could give these people a greater chance at survival, which could lead to "more" developed economy, which could enhance "how well countries could perform, in the "long-term""!</p></td></tr>

			<tr><td><p align = "center" style = "color:white;font-size:14px;">Additionally, an example where subsidies may not lead to a "positive change", is in the case of subsidies related to <b>energy</b>. In some cases, governments may chose to subsidise fuel that comes from energy sources like coal, by not including the potential environmental costs that these might bring about. These include, "climate change", "global warming", etc. As a result, companies might select coal as their fuel source, and not explore other <b>renewable</b> energy sources, like solar energy, wind energy, etc. As a result, sustainability levels may drop, and future generations may not be able to <b>thrive</b>!</p></td><tr>
